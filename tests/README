This directory is ment to be a place to put code tests. As of now every new functionality should have a testcase of some kind. 

Those cases if scritable should be organized in this directory. Basically the concept is very straight forward. 
In the main directory every file ending with a ".sh" at the end is executed. If the script returns a 0 this test is expected to be
successfully. If not the testing terminates until the test/bug is fixed.

If tests are made for the different root filesystems or clustertypes they should reside in the apropriate directories. 
Everything else is the same as in the main directory.
