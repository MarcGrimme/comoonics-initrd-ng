Could not find the rootdevice .
 This usually means either the rootdevice is not mapped to this node and is therefore not seen or
 a higherlevel software - lvm or multipathing - cannot access the rootdevice because it is not setup as such.
 
 The best guess is to manually validate the error then fix it in the initrd base, build a new initrdn and reboot this node.
